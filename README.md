Row-types is a library of open records and variants for Haskell using closed
type families and type literals (among other things...).
See [examples/Examples.lhs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/target/row-types/master/examples/Examples.lhs)
for a literate Haskell file that functions as an overview of how this library can be used,
and check out [the website](https://target.github.io/row-types/) for further examples.

Available on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/row-types).

This work is a branch from CTRex [1,2] with other inspiration from data-diverse [3].
My thanks to the authors and contributors of those libraries!
